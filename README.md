# React Native AsyncStorage: Accessing Data Before Load Completion

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with AsyncStorage in React Native: attempting to access stored data before it has fully loaded.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, such as retrieving data from AsyncStorage, don't complete instantaneously.  If you try to access the data immediately after initiating the retrieval, you'll likely encounter `undefined` or `null` values, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is fully loaded before attempting to use it.  This is typically achieved using asynchronous programming concepts like Promises or async/await.  The `bugSolution.js` example demonstrates using `async/await` to elegantly handle this situation.
